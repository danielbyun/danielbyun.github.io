### Introduction
Hey, my name is Daniel Byun, an aspiring web developer from New York, USA, currently residing in Seoul, South Korea.

I needed a website to host my portfolio, and since I only need a simple site to hold my information and projects, I decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) to showcase my portolio projects.
